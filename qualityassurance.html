				<p>
					My time working in the Quality Assurance department at THQ included a wide varity of testing
					methodologies on a variety of platforms.
					Each platform had its own unique set of challenges that became more complex as the platforms had a
					greater online component.
					It was common to encounter an issue that would need to be fixed differently across multiple
					platforms, in particular when addressing compliance related issues.
